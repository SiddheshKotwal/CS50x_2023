If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

    --> I would characterise audio aura of listener on the basis of ,maximum energy, danceability, and valence.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

    --> I think this hypothesis might not represent the correct audio aura because we are taking average of energy which
        eliminates the energy for particular aura that is listened more often.
    --> So we should consider the audio aura on behalf of the amount of time person listened to particular energy,
        the maximum time spent on the particular energy should be the audio aura of listener
