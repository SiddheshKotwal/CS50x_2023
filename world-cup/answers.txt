Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The real time would have been increased gradually(linearly), but it was nearly same till 100 thousand simulations
and in the last case of 1 million simulations real time increased exponentially

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

100 thousand simulations as it is close to one second
